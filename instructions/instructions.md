# 1000 Months: Life Visualization & Intentionality Tool

## Why "1000 Months"?
The name represents an approximate 80-year lifespan (960 months), rounded up to 1000 for memorability. This intentionally finite number helps users visualize and internalize the limited nature of time. While users can customize their expected lifespan in settings, 1000 months serves as a meaningful default that encourages thoughtful time allocation.

## 1. Product Overview

### Core Purpose
A life visualization and intentionality tool that helps users understand how they allocate their time, fostering intentional living through structured self-reflection.

### Problem Statement
People struggle to visualize their life trajectory, leading to reactive decision-making. There is no tool that cohesively connects past experiences, present priorities, and future goals.

### Solution Statement
1000 Months provides an intuitive visual timeline that integrates memories, lessons, and goals into a structured grid, helping users live with more intentionality.

### Key Value Propositions
- **Time Visualization**: A unique life-grid that visually represents past, present, and future time
- **Intentionality Tool**: Helps users prioritize what matters by tracking key life moments and lessons
- **Seamless Memory Management**: Integrates personal experiences, reflections, and future goals
- **Self-Improvement**: Encourages users to analyze past choices and structure future aspirations

### Target Audience
- Individuals interested in self-improvement and productivity
- Users seeking a structured way to track memories and goals
- People who want a visual representation of their life journey

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 Life Grid System

#### View Modes

##### Week View
- Each cell represents one week
- Cells are organized in 4×13 clusters (52 weeks per year)
- Clusters show simplified versions of cells inside from the default view (for performance)
- Clusters represent years
- 5 clusters fit in a row
- Rows of clusters are labeled with the user age at the start of that row (counting by 5s)
- Total number of clusters is equal to the user's set lifespan (83 by default)
- Current week cell is empty with an accent color as a border
- Users can tap a cluster to expand it into a close view of the cluster
- From this close up cluster view, users can interact with individual week cells to open a detailed week cell view

##### Month View (Default when opening the app)
- Each cell represents a month
- Cells are organized in 3×4 grids (12 months per year)
- Clusters show simplified versions of cells inside from the default view (for performance)
- Clusters represent years
- 5 clusters fit in a row
- Rows of clusters are labeled with the user age at the start of that row (counting by 5s)
- Current month cell is empty with an accent color as a border
- Users can tap a cluster to expand it into a close view of the cluster
- From this close up cluster view, users can interact with individual month cells to open a detailed month cell view

##### Year View
- Each cell represents an entire year
- Current year is empty with an accent color border
- Organized in rows of 10 years
- Tapping a year opens a detailed view of that individual year

#### Grid Interactions

##### Content Indicators
- Memories: Custom emoji or dot
- Lessons: Circle icon
- Goals: Triangle or star (completed goals)
- Multiple items indicated with superscript numbers

##### Cell Detail View
- Opens as a bottom sheet upon tapping a cell
- Displays all relevant content (memories, lessons, goals, reflections)
- Users can add new content directly from this view

##### Long Press Action
- Opens quick-add menu for new content

#### Visual Representation
- Past cells are filled, current cell is empty with an accent color border, future cells are empty with a regular border

### Technical Considerations
#### Performance
- From the default grid view in weeks and months view modes, clusters should use simplified versions of the cells within simply showing the cells (past, present, future) state for better performance
- Memoization for preventing unnecessary re-renders

#### Visual Design
- Blue/teal gradient accent color for highlighting
- Light/Dark mode support (dark mode by default)
- Clear visual hierarchy for different time scales
