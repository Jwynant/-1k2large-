# 1000 Months: Life Visualization & Intentionality Tool

## Why "1000 Months"?
The name represents an approximate 80-year lifespan (960 months), rounded up to 1000 for memorability. This intentionally finite number helps users visualize and internalize the limited nature of time. While users can customize their expected lifespan in settings, 1000 months serves as a meaningful default that encourages thoughtful time allocation.
